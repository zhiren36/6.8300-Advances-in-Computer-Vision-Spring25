# MIT6.8300

Problem set and solutions to 6.8300 Advances in computer vision at MIT, as taught in spring 2025. 


## Course Contents
This course dives into advanced concepts in computer vision. A first focus is geometry in computer vision, including image formation, represnetation theory for vision, classic multi-view geometry, multi-view geometry in the age of deep learning, differentiable rendering, neural scene representations, correspondence estimation, optical flow computation, and point tracking.

Next, we explore generative modeling and representation learning including image and video generation, guidance in diffusion models, conditional probabilistic models, as well as representation learning in the form of contrastive and masking-based methods.

Finally, we will explore the intersection of robotics and computer vision with "vision for embodied agents", investigating the role of vision for decision-making, planning and control.
